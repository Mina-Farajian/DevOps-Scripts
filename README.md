### Terraform AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project
Overview
This Terraform project is designed to provision and manage AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It organizes AWS resources into different modules, making it easy to deploy and maintain complex infrastructure.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following directories and more so i put some sample explaination here:

* ec2-instances: This module creates EC2 instances within the previously defined VPC and subnets. You can specify the number of instances, instance types, and other instance-specific configurations.

* rds-database: The RDS module provisions a managed Relational Database Service (RDS) instance. It allows you to set up database engines, instance types, and database options.

* s3-bucket: This module creates an Amazon S3 bucket. You can specify the bucket name, access control policies, and other S3-specific configurations.

* iam-roles: The IAM module defines Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for EC2 instances, allowing them to interact with other AWS services securely.

Terraform
AWS CLI
AWS IAM credentials with appropriate permissions
## Usage
1- Clone this repository to your local machine.
2- Change into the project directory:
```
cd terraform-aws-iac-project
```
3- Create a terraform.tfvars file to set your AWS access and secret keys, or use environment variables.

4- Initialize Terraform and download the required providers:
```
terraform init
```
5-Review and customize the variables in the module .tf files as needed, such as VPC settings, RDS configurations, and EC2 instance specifications.

6- Plan the changes:
```
terraform plan
```
7- Apply the configuration:
```
terraform apply
```
Happy Terraforming! ðŸš€
